# CurrencyConverter
Simple WPF application to convert currencies

# About:

This is a simple application that provides up to date currency conversion. For now, only conversions from USD and EUR are available due to api limitations.

I used .NET Core since it is better for scalability and to integrate with other technologies. Since a currency converter is a feature that may be used with other projects, this project libraries can be extended and used in these other projects.

There is still a lot to do in this project:

# Next planned Features:

- Conversion for the rest of the currencies (so far, only USD and EUR are available)
- Statistics and forecasts of market information (Currency appreciation and depreciation)
- Quick link to multi-currencies websites to make exchanges (Transferwise, for instance)

# Next technical improvements (TODO):

- Add EntityFramework or other ORM for database
- Add View Models to solution and MVVM architecture pattern
- Add Tests
